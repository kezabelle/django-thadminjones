===================
Thadmin Jones 0.1.0
===================

`thadminjones` is a package for the `Django`_ `admin`_ backend, implementing
a new theme, reminiscent of the `Wordpress`_ administration.

It's less of a whole-sale replacement than many other packages, insofar
as only the following templates have been changed:

* `admin/base_site.html`
* `admin/filter.html`

and the existing CSS is built upon, rather than thrown out to start from
scratch.

Due to the non-intrusive nature of the theme, things like nice responsive
changelist tables haven't been addressed.

The license
-----------

Let us get this out of the way. It's GPLv2. Not the license I'd have
picked, but `Wordpress`_ is also `GPLv2`_, and as this is probably considered
a derivitive work, the viral nature of the GPL requires this be
GPL compatible, and I don't know licenses enough to make an informed
decision as to whether another license would be permissable.

I'm sorry if that means you can't use this, or contribute to it.

How to install
--------------

Edit your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to reflect the new
package::

  INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'thadminjones',
    'django.contrib.admin',
  )

Due to the way templates are discovered, you must explicitly opt-in to
using the `thadminjones` templates, which means the package **must** be
before the standard `admin`_ package.

Alternatively, if you have any ``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` which include any of
the following templates, you may need to adapt those to include the
template changes required by `thadminjones`:

* `admin/base_site.html`
* `admin/filter.html`

Features
--------

The **quick add** menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a convienience, it is possible to have certain ``ModelAdmin``
instances listed in a **Quick Add** menu at the top of every
page; to enable a ``ModelAdmin`` in this menu, you can either
inherit from the ``SupportsQuickAdd`` mixin class::

  from thadminjones.admin import SupportsQuickAdd

  class MyModelAdmin(SupportsQuickAdd, ModelAdmin):
      pass

or you can define ``has_quick_add_permission`` and ``get_quick_add_url`` methods
on your existing ``ModelAdmin``. See the implementation of the mixin
class for implementation info.

What about third party apps?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other apps can have styles pulled in by including a file in::

  <app.name>/static/<last.part.of.app.name>/css/thadminjones.css

They will be put in the right place by the `collectstatic`_
management command, and are discovered by a template tag in the
bundled `admin/base_site.html` which looks for certain filenames
using the AppDirectories `staticfiles`_ finder.

By way of example, take the minor changes made to `django-treeadmin`_:

* The ``<app.name>`` that is used in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` is
  ``thadminjones.contrib.treeadmin``
* The CSS is in ``static/treeadmin/css`` - the ``<last.part.of.app.name>``; only
  the last part of the dot path is used, allowing us to provide tweaks to third
  party packages without reaching out and asking them to bundle said tweaks.

About the name
--------------

It's a play on words, a reference to `Thad Jones`_, a Jazz musician.
I'm hardly alone in naming `Django`_ packages in relation to Jazz,
as off the top of my head I can think of:

* `Grappelli`_ (`Stéphane Grappelli`_)
* `Ella`_ (`Ella Fitzgerald`_)
* `Armstrong`_ (`Louis Armstrong`_)
* `Ellington`_ (`Duke Ellington`_)
* `Mingus`_ (`Charles Mingus`_)
* (maybe) `django-bakery`_ (`Chet Baker`_)

Screenshots
-----------

The following images are vaguely representative of the theme, though there
may be discrepencies because taking screenshots every time I fix or change
something is likely to be tiresome. They've been scrubbed by `ImageOptim`_ too...

Contributing
------------

The quickest way to get up and running to contribute is::

    $ mkvirtualenv thadmin
    $ git clone git@github.com:kezabelle/django-thadminjones.git
    $ python django-thadminjones/setup.py develop

Which will install all the requirements for running the ``test_project``,
thereafter, you can spin up a clean-room project accessible at 127.0.0.1:8080
by doing::

    $ python django-thadminjones/test_project/run.py

Tickets can be opened on the `django-thadminjones GitHub repository`_ - if you're
reporting a visual bug, please try to include a screenshot illustrating the
problem, or a pull request for the ``test_project`` to demonstrate it.
